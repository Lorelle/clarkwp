The following is a general to do list for ClarkWP SVN. It is for the instructors only.

# Include how to link to issues by typing issue 61 in the descriptions and comments. This will be used to identify related articles, articles that must be published first, etc.
# Descriptions of every Open and Closed Status (that is applicable)
# Descriptions of every Label and how to use them
# Add labels to categorize wiki pages as tutorials, etc. No hurry.
