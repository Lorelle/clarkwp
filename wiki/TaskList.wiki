= To Do List =

The following is a general to do list for ClarkWP SVN. It is for the instructors only.

 # Include how to link to issues by typing issue 61 in the descriptions and comments. This will be used to identify related articles, articles that must be published first, etc.
 # Descriptions of every Open and Closed Status (that is applicable)
 # Descriptions of every Label and how to use them
 # Add labels to categorize wiki pages as tutorials, etc. No hurry.
 # Figure out and explain how to edit an issue if a mistake is made.
  * I'm not finding anything except that we can't change it if it has been "commited" but these are issues, not commits. May email a friend and ask. I can't find anything, but maybe you can while we wait for a reply. ARGH.
