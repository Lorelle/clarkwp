==How to Submit an Article Suggestion in SVN==

Detailed instructions are included in this wiki, but here are the basics:

To submit an article suggestion:
  
    # Go to *Issues*
    # Click *New Issue*
    # *Template:* Select the template type from the drop-down menu (default is 'Article Suggestion')
    # *Summary:* Fill in a short summary of the task or article.
    # *Description:* Fill in the template to the best of your ability to outline the specifics of the article or task. Note: Choose the appropriate 'Skills' from the list provided and delete those that are not applicable.
    # *Status:* The status should be set as 'New,' which is the default,
    # *Owner:* Leave Owner as blank. Students will accept ownership.
    # *Cc:* Leave blank
    # *Labels:* Fill in labels. Labels are predefined and some will already contain a default value. For those without a default value, click in the label box and a drop-down list of options to choose from will appear. See more About Labels below.
    # Be sure to click the *"Submit Issue"* button at the bottom before exiting the screen.
